          <h1>A List of the Best Weight Training Exercises for Each Muscle Group</h1>
          <p>The most common and straight forward way of categorizing weight training exercises is simply in terms what muscle group or body part an exercise targets.</p>
          <p>While some explaining was necessary to properly show the difference between free weight exercises, body weight exercises and machines, and compound exercises and isolation exercises, and of course the different weight training movement patterns, very little explaining is needed here.</p>
          <p>In fact, all this is going to be is just a big list of exercises for each muscle group with virtually no explanation whatsoever.</p>
          <p>So, let’s get to it.</p>
          <p>In no specific order, here’s a list of what are considered to be the best and most often used exercises for each major muscle group…</p>

            <h1 class="media-heading">Barbell Squats</h4>
            <p>Muscles worked: Quads, Glutes</p>
            <p>Begin with the barbell supported on top of the traps. Adopt a hip-width stance with the feet turned out as needed.</p>
            <p>Descend by flexing the knees, refraining from moving the hips back as much as possible. This requires that the knees travel forward. Ensure that they stay align with the feet. The goal is to keep the torso as upright as possible.</p>
            <p>Continue all the way down, keeping the weight on the front of the heel. At the moment the upper legs contact the lower legs reverse the motion, driving the weight upward.</p>

            <h1 class="media-heading">Dip</h4>
            <p>Muscles worked: Triceps</p>
            <p>Use dip bars if available, or place your palms on a bench, chair  or floor and extend legs in front of you. Lower your body until your upper arms are parallel to the floor, but no lower. Extend your elbows to come up.</p>

            <h1 class="media-heading">Standing Dumbbell Triceps Extension</h4>
            <p>Muscles worked: Triceps</p>
            <p>Stand up with a dumbbell held by both hands. Your feet should be about shoulder width apart from each other. Slowly use both hands to grab the dumbbell and lift it over your head until both arms are fully extended.</p>
            <p>Keeping your upper arms close to your head with elbows in and perpendicular to the floor, lower the resistance in a semicircular motion behind your head until your forearms touch your biceps.</p>
            <p>Go back to the starting position by using the triceps to raise the dumbbell. Breathe out as you perform this step.</p>
